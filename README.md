# GameDevTV-Unity3D-ArgonAssault
This is a game that I created as part of the GameDev.TV Unity3D course.

## Aim of the Game
You play as a World War 2 fighter plane fighter enemy forces.

The plane follows a set track however, the player as the ability to move up, down, left, and right. Using these controls and the ability to shoot, the player can dodge and destroy enemy vehicles gaining points.

## Updates
### v1.0.0
The basics of the game have been developed however, designing the rest of the level and other sections of the level have been postponed until I have learnt more about C#, Unity, and Blender.
